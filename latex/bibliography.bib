Although several extensive review papers have already been published in the general HAR topics, the growing technologies in the field as well as the multi-disciplinary nature of HAR prompt the need for constant updates in the field. In this respect, this paper attempts to review and summarize the progress of HAR systems from the computer vision perspective. Indeed, most computer vision applications such as human computer interaction, virtual reality, security, video surveillance and home monitoring are highly correlated to HAR tasks. This establishes new trend and milestone in the development cycle of HAR systems. Therefore, the current survey aims to provide the reader with an up to date analysis of vision-based HAR related literature and recent progress in the field. At the same time, it will highlight the main challenges and future directions.},

abstract = {We address the classic problems of detection, segmentation and pose estimation of people in images with a novel definition of a part, a poselet. We postulate two criteria (1) It should be easy to find a poselet given an input image (2) it should be easy to localize the 3D configuration of the person conditioned on the detection of a poselet. To permit this we have built a new dataset, H3D, of annotations of humans in 2D photographs with 3D joint information, inferred using anthropometric constraints. This enables us to implement a data-driven search procedure for finding poselets that are tightly clustered in both 3D joint configuration space as well as 2D image appearance. The algorithm discovers poselets that correspond to frontal and profile faces, pedestrians, head and shoulder views, among others. Each poselet provides examples for training a linear SVM classifier which can then be run over the image in a multiscale scanning mode. The outputs of these poselet detectors can be thought of as an intermediate layer of nodes, on top of which one can run a second layer of classification or regression. We show how this permits detection and localization of torsos or keypoints such as left shoulder, nose, etc. Experimental results show that we obtain state of the art performance on people detection in the PASCAL VOC 2007 challenge, among other datasets. We are making publicly available both the H3D dataset as well as the poselet parameters for use by other researchers.},

abstract = {System theoretic approaches to action recognition model the dynamics of a scene with linear dynamical systems (LDSs) and perform classification using metrics on the space of LDSs, e.g. Binet-Cauchy kernels. However, such approaches are only applicable to time series data living in a Euclidean space, e.g. joint trajectories extracted from motion capture data or feature point trajectories extracted from video. Much of the success of recent object recognition techniques relies on the use of more complex feature descriptors, such as SIFT descriptors or HOG descriptors, which are essentially histograms. Since histograms live in a non-Euclidean space, we can no longer model their temporal evolution with LDSs, nor can we classify them using a metric for LDSs. In this paper, we propose to represent each frame of a video using a histogram of oriented optical flow (HOOF) and to recognize human actions by classifying HOOF time-series. For this purpose, we propose a generalization of the Binet-Cauchy kernels to nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDS) whose output lives in a non-Euclidean space, e.g. the space of histograms. This can be achieved by using kernels defined on the original non-Euclidean space, leading to a well-defined metric for NLDSs. We use these kernels for the classification of actions in video sequences using (HOOF) as the output of the NLDS. We evaluate our approach to recognition of human actions in several scenarios and achieve encouraging results. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

It achieves left and right-hand tracking, and face and facial feature detection (eye, nose, and ears) detection. The system is easily implemented with a consumer-grade computer and an affordable Kinect device and is robust to drastic background and illumination changes. The system was tested and achieved a successful monitoring percentage of 96.28%. The automation of the human body parts motion monitoring, its analysis in relation to the psychomotor exercise indicated to the patient, and the storage of the result of the realization of a set of exercises free the rehabilitation experts of doing such demanding tasks.

abstract = {We consider the automated recognition of human actions in surveillance videos. Most current methods build classifiers based on complex handcrafted features computed from the raw inputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep model that can act directly on the raw inputs. However, such models are currently limited to handling 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety of different models. We apply the developed models to recognize human actions in the real-world environment of airport surveillance videos, and they achieve superior performance in comparison to baseline methods. {\textcopyright} 1979-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on 3D convolutional neural networks, without using hand-crafted features or RNN architectures exclusively for encoding temporal information. The improved internal designs adopt compact but effective bottleneck units for learning motion patterns and leverage the DenseNet architecture to promote feature reusing and channel interaction, which is proved to be more capable of capturing spatiotemporal features and requires relatively fewer parameters. The performance of the proposed model is validated on three standard datasets in terms of recognition accuracy compared to other advanced approaches. Meanwhile, supplementary experiments are carried out to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. The final results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.},

At the lower level, body poses are encoded in a representative but discriminative pose dictionary. At the intermediate level, encoded poses span a space where simple human actions are composed. At the highest level, our model captures temporal and spatial compositions of actions into complex human activities. Our human activity classifier simultaneously models which body parts are relevant to the action of interest as well as their appearance and composition using a discriminative approach. By formulating model learning in a max-margin framework, our approach achieves powerful multi-class discrimination while providing useful annotations at the intermediate semantic level. We show how our hierarchical compositional model provides natural handling of occlusions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we introduce a new dataset of composed human activities.

Knowledge about spatio-temporal structure is encoded using first-order logic using an approach based on Allen's Interval Logic, and robustness to low-level observation uncertainty is provided by Markov Logic Networks (MLN). Our main contribution is that we integrate interval-based temporal reasoning with probabilistic logical inference, relying on an efficient bottom-up grounding scheme to avoid combinatorial explosion. Applied to one-on-one basketball, our framework detects and tracks players, their hands and feet, and the ball, generates event observations from the resulting trajectories, and performs probabilistic logical inference to determine the most consistent sequence of events.

abstract = {In this paper we develop a system for human behaviour recognition in video sequences. Human behaviour is modelled as a stochastic sequence of actions. Actions are described by a feature vector comprising both trajectory information (position and velocity), and a set of local motion descriptors. Action recognition is achieved via probabilistic search of image feature databases representing previously seen actions. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) which encode scene rules are used to smooth sequences of actions. High-level behaviour recognition is achieved by computing the likelihood that a set of predefined HMMs explains the current action sequence. Thus, human actions and behaviour are represented using a hierarchy of abstraction: from person-centred actions, to actions with spatio-temporal context, to action sequences and, finally, general behaviours. While the upper levels all use Bayesian networks and belief propagation, the lowest level uses non-parametric sampling from a previously learned database of actions. The combined method represents a general framework for human behaviour modelling.

Human activity prediction is a probabilistic process of inferring ongoing activities from videos only containing onsets (i.e. the beginning part) of the activities. The goal is to enable early recognition of unfinished activities as opposed to the after-the-fact classification of completed activities. Activity prediction methodologies are particularly necessary for surveillance systems which are required to prevent crimes and dangerous activities from occurring. We probabilistically formulate the activity prediction problem, and introduce new methodologies designed for the prediction. We represent an activity as an integral histogram of spatio-temporal features, efficiently modeling how feature distributions change over time. The new recognition methodology named dynamic bag-of-words is developed, which considers sequential nature of human activities while maintaining advantages of the bag-of-words to handle noisy observations. Our experiments confirm that our approach reliably recognizes ongoing activities from streaming videos with a high accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

The challenge is to capture the complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion between frames. We also aim to generalise the best performing hand-crafted features within a data-driven learning framework. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a two-stream ConvNet architecture which incorporates spatial and temporal networks. Second, we demonstrate that a ConvNet trained on multi-frame dense optical flow is able to achieve very good performance in spite of limited training data. Finally, we show that multitask learning, applied to two different action classification datasets, can be used to increase the amount of training data and improve the performance on both. Our architecture is trained and evaluated on the standard video actions benchmarks of UCF-101 and HMDB-51, where it is competitive with the state of the art. It also exceeds by a large margin previous attempts to use deep nets for video classification.},

abstract = {Recent progress has shown that learning from hierarchical feature representations leads to improvements in various computer vision tasks. Motivated by the observation that human activity data contains information at various temporal resolutions, we present a hierarchical sequence summarization approach for action recognition that learns multiple layers of discriminative feature representations at different temporal granularities. We build up a hierarchy dynamically and recursively by alternating sequence learning and sequence summarization. For sequence learning we use CRFs with latent variables to learn hidden spatio-temporal dynamics, for sequence summarization we group observations that have similar semantic meaning in the latent space. For each layer we learn an abstract feature representation through non-linear gate functions. This procedure is repeated to obtain a hierarchical sequence summary representation. We develop an efficient learning method to train our model and show that its complexity grows sub linearly with the size of the hierarchy. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach, achieving the best published results on the Arm Gesture and Canal9 datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recently dense trajectories were shown to be an efficient video representation for action recognition and achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of datasets. This paper improves their performance by taking into account camera motion to correct them. To estimate camera motion, we match feature points between frames using SURF descriptors and dense optical flow, which are shown to be complementary. These matches are, then, used to robustly estimate a homography with RANSAC. Human motion is in general different from camera motion and generates inconsistent matches. To improve the estimation, a human detector is employed to remove these matches. Given the estimated camera motion, we remove trajectories consistent with it. We also use this estimation to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This significantly improves motion-based descriptors, such as HOF and MBH. Experimental results on four challenging action datasets (i.e., Hollywood2, HMDB51, Olympic Sports and UCF50) significantly outperform the current state of the art. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is one of the most important and challenging problems in the computer vision. It has critical application in wide variety of tasks including gaming, human–robot interaction, rehabilitation, sports, health monitoring, video surveillance, and robotics. HAR is challenging due to the complex posture made by the human and multiple people interaction. Various artifacts that commonly appears in the scene such as illuminations variations, clutter, occlusions, background diversity further adds the complexity to HAR. Sensors for multiple modalities could be used to overcome some of these inherent challenges. Such sensors could include an RGB-D camera, infrared sensors, thermal cameras, inertial sensors, etc. This article introduces a comprehensive review of different multimodal human activity recognition methods where different types of sensors being used along with their analytical approaches and fusion methods. Further, this article presents classification and discussion of existing work within seven rational aspects: (a) what are the applications of HAR; (b) what are the single and multi-modality sensing for HAR; (c) what are different vision based approaches for HAR; (d) what and how wearable sensors based system contributes to the HAR; (e) what are different multimodal HAR methods; (f) how a combination of vision and wearable inertial sensors based system contributes to the HAR; and (g) challenges and future directions in HAR. With a more and comprehensive understanding of multimodal human activity recognition, more research in this direction can be motivated and refined.},

abstract = {The bag of interest points (BIPs) approach is a good strategy for human action recognition, but it ignores much information contained in the spatial-temporal interest points (STIPs), while the lost information is helpful for classification. In this paper, a new action descriptor based on the STIPs is proposed: histogram of interest point locations (HIPLs). HIPL reorganizes STIPs and reflects the spatial location information, and can be viewed as a useful supplement to the BIP feature. Multiple features including BIP and HIPL are extracted to describe human actions, however, it leads to over-fitting easily by combining them directly because the dimension of feature vector is too high. To overcome this problem, a novel classifier combination framework is developed to integrate the multiple features, and AdaBoost and sparse representation (SR) are used as basic algorithms. Experiments on KTH and UCF sports datasets which are two benchmarks in human action recognition, show that our results are either comparable to, or significantly better than previously published results on these benchmarks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The two-stream CNNs prove very successful for video-based action recognition. However, the classical two-stream CNNs are time costly, mainly due to the bottleneck of calculating optical flows (OFs). In this paper, we propose a two-stream-based real-time action recognition approach by using motion vector (MV) to replace OF. MVs are encoded in video stream and can be extracted directly without extra calculation. However, directly training CNN with MVs degrades accuracy severely due to the noise and the lack of fine details in MVs. In order to relieve this problem, we propose four training strategies which leverage the knowledge learned from OF CNN to enhance the accuracy of MV CNN. Our insight is that MV and OF share inherent similar structures which allow us to transfer knowledge from one domain to another. To fully utilize the knowledge learned in OF domain, we develop deeply transferred MV CNN. Experimental results on various datasets show the effectiveness of our training strategies. Our approach is significantly faster than OF based approaches and achieves processing speed of 390.7 frames per second, surpassing real-time requirement. We release our model and code to facilitate further research.11https://github.com/zbwglory/MV-release.},
